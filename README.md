# Deep Learning A-Z

The idea here is to deploy neural network for predicting the output.
The input data set could comprise of either numbers, images, audio files or video files.

### 1. Forward propogation
Consider this as an open loop control system, where the input state is independent of the output state(Eg. Turning on light using a switch).

This can be implemented using keras(https://github.com/keras-team/keras) that uses input layer/s, hidden layer/s and output layer/s.
Uploaded python file shows step-by-step deployment using keras to generate the output
